<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many different app out there that claim you can learn to code without paying a thing. The reality is, 9/10 of these "free" apps requie you to pay to unlock a full course. codeLab has been built with this in mind, featuring courses for the most popular languages that are fully unlocked the moment you download the app.

Here's why you should download codeLab:
* It is COMPLETELY free, the app has no in-app purchases available
* Downloading codeLab will help support the open-source community
* It helps support us, two students who have put hundreds of hours of work into this :smile:

As you can imagine, this can't be done without any money, as there is quite a lot funds required. codeLab on the App Store does contain adverts, but we took them out for the GitHub repo. If you can, please install through the App Store - it helps us out a bunch!

Open `codeLab.xcworkspace` to get started.

1. Setup your Firebase app with authentication at [https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)
2. Make sure you are using `codeLab.xcworkspace`
3. Edit the `info.plist` file and add your App ID at GADApplicationIdentifier
4. Build the project
